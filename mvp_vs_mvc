    Here are the key differences between the patterns:

    MVP Pattern

        View is more loosely coupled to the model. The presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view.
        Easier to unit test because interaction with the view is through an interface
        Usually view to presenter map one to one. Complex views may have multi presenters.

    MVC Pattern

        Controller are based on behaviors and can be shared across views
        Can be responsible for determining which view to display
